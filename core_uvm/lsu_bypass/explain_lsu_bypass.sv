This Verilog module implements a Load Store Unit (LSU) controller for a processor. The controller receives requests for loads or stores (lsu_req_i) and their validity flag (lsu_req_valid_i), and generates the corresponding signals to the memory interface to fetch or store data. It also handles the case when multiple requests arrive simultaneously or when a request arrives while the LSU is not ready to handle it.

The controller is composed of two independent blocks, one for loads and another for stores. They share a common address translation block. The LSU controller keeps track of the readiness of each block (through the ready_o signal) and, if they are not ready, it keeps the last signals applied stable. When a request arrives, the controller stores it in a two-element FIFO and samples the next one. If needed, the controller can keep the request in the FIFO until the LSU is ready to handle it. If the LSU has more than one request pending, the controller chooses which one to handle next based on the order they arrived.

The controller has inputs to pop (remove) a load or store request from the FIFO (pop_ld_i and pop_st_i, respectively). The controller also has an input to flush the FIFO (flush_i), which clears all pending requests.

The internal logic of the controller is implemented using combinational and sequential logic. The combinational part updates status variables and the FIFO content based on the inputs. The sequential part consists of four D flip-flops that store the current state of the FIFO (mem_q, status_cnt_q, write_pointer_q, and read_pointer_q). The next state of the FIFO is computed in the combinational part and stored in the corresponding variables (mem_n, status_cnt_n, write_pointer_n, and read_pointer_n). The current state of the FIFO is available on the mem_q variable, and the current read pointer is available on the read_pointer_q variable.

Finally, the controller generates the lsu_ctrl_o signal based on the contents of the FIFO and the incoming requests. If the FIFO is empty, the controller forwards the incoming request directly to the memory interface. If the FIFO is not empty, the controller selects the oldest request from the FIFO and forwards it to the memory interface.
