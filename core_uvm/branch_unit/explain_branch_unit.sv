The branch unit is responsible for calculating the target address of a branch instruction and comparing it to the predicted address. If there is a misprediction, the branch unit will update the branch target buffer (BTB) and branch history table (BHT).

The branch unit takes as input the current PC, the instruction being executed, and the predicted branch address. It also takes as input the result of the ALU comparison, which is used to determine whether the branch was taken or not.

The branch unit first calculates the target address of the branch instruction. This is done by adding the jump base (which is either the current PC or the register specified by the JALR instruction) to the immediate value of the instruction.

The branch unit then compares the calculated target address to the predicted address. If the addresses are the same, the branch is considered to be a hit and the branch unit does not need to do anything else. If the addresses are different, the branch is considered to be a misprediction and the branch unit will update the BTB and BHT.

The branch unit also sets the `resolve_branch_o` signal to 1'b1. This signal is used by the ID stage to indicate that the branch has been resolved and that the next instruction can be fetched.

The branch unit also sets the `branch_exception_o` signal to an appropriate value if there is a misprediction. The possible values of the `branch_exception_o` signal are:

* `ariane_pkg::EX_MISPREDICT_BRANCH`: The branch was mispredicted.
* `ariane_pkg::EX_MISPREDICT_JALR`: The JALR instruction was mispredicted.
* `ariane_pkg::EX_MISPREDICT_RETURN`: The return instruction was mispredicted.
