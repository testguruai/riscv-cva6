# Explanation for: re_name.sv
The verilog code is for a module that re-names registers in a processor pipeline. The module takes in the clock signal, an asynchronous reset signal, a flush signal, an input instruction and its validity signal, and outputs the renamed instruction and its validity signal. 

The renamed instruction is produced based on the renaming of destination and source registers in the instruction. The renaming is done by updating two tables - one for general-purpose registers (GPR) and the other for floating point registers (FPR). The incoming instruction is first copied to the output instruction, and then the source and destination registers are updated to use the latest renaming scheme.

The renaming scheme is based on a naming bit, which is XORed with the register's current state. If the register is a floating point register, the naming bit is taken from the FPR table, otherwise from the GPR table. 

The naming bit for source registers is based on their current state, and for destination registers on their future state after renaming. The register zero is non-writable and is not renamed.

The tables are updated when an instruction is acknowledged by the pipeline and flushed when a flush signal is received.
