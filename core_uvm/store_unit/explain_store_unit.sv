The store unit is responsible for handling all store requests and atomic memory operations (AMOs).

The first part of the code defines the state machine for the store unit. The state machine has four states:

* IDLE: The store unit is idle and waiting for a new store request.
* VALID_STORE: The store unit has received a valid store request and is waiting for the address translation to complete.
* WAIT_TRANSLATION: The store unit is waiting for the address translation to complete.
* WAIT_STORE_READY: The store unit is waiting for the store buffer to be ready to accept a new store request.

The second part of the code defines the control signals for the store unit. These signals include the translation request, the valid signal, the store buffer ready signal, and the pop store signal.

The translation request signal is used to request an address translation from the MMU. The valid signal is used to indicate that the store unit has received a valid store request. The store buffer ready signal is used to indicate that the store buffer is ready to accept a new store request. The pop store signal is used to pop the oldest store request from the store buffer.

The third part of the code defines the datapath for the store unit. The datapath includes the store buffer, the address translation logic, and the AMO logic.

The store buffer is used to store store requests until they can be committed to memory. The address translation logic is used to translate the virtual address of a store request to a physical address. The AMO logic is used to handle atomic memory operations.

The fourth part of the code defines the output assignments for the store unit. These assignments include the virtual address, the transaction ID, the valid signal, and the exception signal.

The virtual address is the address of the store request. The transaction ID is a unique identifier for the store request. The valid signal is used to indicate that the store unit has a valid store request. The exception signal is used to indicate that an exception occurred during the store operation.
