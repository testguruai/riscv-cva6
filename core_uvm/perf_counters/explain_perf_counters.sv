# VerifAI TestGuru
# Explanation for: perf_counters.sv
This is a Verilog module for implementing performance counters in a RISC-V processor. The module takes in various inputs, including clock and reset signals, as well as signals from other parts of the processor such as cache accesses, TLB misses, and commit instructions. It also has a memory interface for reading and writing the performance counters.

The module updates the performance counters based on various events in the processor, such as cache misses, branch instructions, and exceptions. It can also output the value of a specific counter based on the address supplied through the memory interface.

The module includes two always blocks. The always_comb block updates the current value of the performance counters based on the inputs received from other parts of the processor. The always_ff block updates the value of the performance counters at the rising edge of the clock signal, using the current value stored in a flip-flop as the input.

The module uses various constants and parameters defined in a separate package imported through the "ariane_pkg" module.
