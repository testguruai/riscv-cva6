# Explanation for: dromajo_ram.sv
This Verilog code describes a synchronous single-port RAM with byte-wise enable and optional output registers. The RAM has a configurable address width, data depth, and number of output registers. The RAM module supports both read and write operations. 

The inputs of the module include Clk_CI (the clock signal), Rst_RBI (the reset signal), CSel_SI (the chip select signal), WrEn_SI (the write enable signal), BEn_SI (the byte enable signal), WrData_DI (the data to be written), and Addr_DI (the address where the data is to be written or read). The output of the module is RdData_DO (the data read from the RAM).

The RAM array is implemented using Mem_DP, which is an array of width DATA_BYTES*8-1 and depth DATA_DEPTH-1. The size of the data "words" written and read is defined by DATA_BYTES, which is currently set to 8 bytes. 

The module also includes an initial block that enables synchronization of the RAM with a Dromajo simulator. It reads memory values from a specified checkpoint file and initializes the memory array Mem_DP accordingly.

The always block updates Mem_DP on a write operation and assigns the value at the specified address to RdData_DN on a read operation. The output registers are optional but can be useful for timing and testing purposes. If enabled, the output data is latched in RdData_DP on the positive edge of the clock signal. If not enabled, the output data is directly assigned to RdData_DP. Finally, RdData_DP is assigned to RdData_DO, which represents the output of the module. 

The module also includes an assertion that checks whether the data depth is within bounds. It raises an error if the depth is greater than 2^ADDR_WIDTH.
