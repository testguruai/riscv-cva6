The scoreboard is a data structure that keeps track of all decoded, issued and committed instructions. It is used to ensure that instructions are executed in the correct order and that no instructions are lost. The scoreboard is implemented as a circular buffer of fixed size. The buffer is divided into three sections: the decoded section, the issued section, and the committed section.

The decoded section contains the instructions that have been decoded but not yet issued. The issued section contains the instructions that have been issued to the execution units but not yet committed. The committed section contains the instructions that have been committed to memory.

The scoreboard uses a pointer to keep track of the current position in the buffer. The pointer is incremented when an instruction is decoded and decremented when an instruction is committed. The scoreboard also uses a flag to indicate whether the buffer is full. The flag is set when the pointer reaches the end of the buffer.

The scoreboard is used by the decode stage to ensure that no instructions are issued out of order. The decode stage checks the scoreboard to see if the instruction that it is trying to decode is already in the buffer. If the instruction is already in the buffer, the decode stage waits until the instruction is committed before decoding the next instruction.

The scoreboard is also used by the execution units to ensure that no instructions are committed out of order. The execution units check the scoreboard to see if the instruction that they are trying to commit is already in the committed section. If the instruction is already in the committed section, the execution units wait until the instruction is retired before committing the next instruction.

The scoreboard is a critical part of the processor pipeline. It ensures that instructions are executed in the correct order and that no instructions are lost.
