# Explanation for: issue_stage.sv
The verilog code represents an issue stage module in a processor design. This module is responsible for dispatching instructions to the functional units (FUs) and keeping track of them in a scoreboard-like data structure. 

The module has input ports for clock and asynchronous reset signal, as well as various control signals such as flush_i and flush_unissued_instr_i. It also has input ports for decoded instruction, its validity, and control flow information (is_ctrl_flow_i). Output ports include the forwarding of operands to the FUs, pc_o, is_compressed_instr_o, branch prediction signals, and various valid/acknowledge signals.

The module is composed of three sub-modules: re_name, scoreboard, and issue_read_operands. The re_name module handles instruction renaming, the scoreboard module maintains the pipeline stages and instruction status, and the issue_read_operands module dispatches the instructions to the appropriate FUs.

Overall, the module represents a critical component in the processor pipeline, responsible for coordinating instruction execution and ensuring timely completion of instructions while avoiding conflicts between different functional units.
