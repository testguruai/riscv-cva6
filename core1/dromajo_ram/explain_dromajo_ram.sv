This is a module that implements a synchronous single-port RAM with byte-wise enable. It is a modified version of the Inferable, Synchronous Single-Port N x 64bit RAM with Byte-Wise Enable module from the Chisel library. The main difference is that this module supports dromajo cosimulation.

The module has the following parameters:

* ADDR_WIDTH: The width of the address bus.
* DATA_DEPTH: The depth of the RAM.
* OUT_REGS: A flag that indicates whether to use output registers.

The module has the following inputs:

* Clk_CI: The clock input.
* Rst_RBI: The reset input.
* CSel_SI: The chip select input.
* WrEn_SI: The write enable input.
* BEn_SI: The byte enable input.
* WrData_DI: The write data input.
* Addr_DI: The address input.

The module has the following outputs:

* RdData_DO: The read data output.

The module works as follows. When the chip select input is asserted, the write enable input controls whether data is written to the RAM. If the write enable input is asserted, the byte enable input controls which bytes of the RAM are written to. The write data input is used to write data to the RAM. The address input specifies the address of the data to be written.

When the chip select input is asserted, the read data output is the data that is stored at the address specified by the address input. If any of the bytes of the address are not enabled by the byte enable input, the corresponding bytes of the read data output are 0.

The module also includes optional output registers. If the output registers are enabled, the read data output is stored in a register before being sent to the output. This can be useful to ensure that the read data output is stable before it is used.
