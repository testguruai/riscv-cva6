The commit stage is responsible for committing the instructions from the scoreboard to the architectural state. It also handles atomic memory operations (AMOs).

The first part of the code assigns the register file write address to the register file write address output. This is the address of the register that is being written to.

The second part of the code assigns the PC to the PC output. This is the program counter that will be used to fetch the next instruction.

The third part of the code sets the dirty FP state output to 1 if any of the instructions being committed are related to the FPU. This is necessary to ensure that the FPU state is updated correctly.
