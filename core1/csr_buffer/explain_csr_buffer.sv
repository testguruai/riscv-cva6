This module is a buffer that holds the CSR address. It acts like a functional unit to the scoreboard.

The module has two inputs: clk_i and rst_ni. clk_i is the clock signal and rst_ni is the asynchronous reset active low.

The module has three inputs: flush_i, fu_data_i, and csr_valid_i. flush_i is a control signal that indicates whether to flush the buffer. fu_data_i is the input data from the scoreboard. csr_valid_i is a valid signal from the scoreboard.

The module has three outputs: csr_ready_o, csr_result_o, and csr_addr_o. csr_ready_o is a ready signal that indicates whether the buffer is ready to accept new data. csr_result_o is the output data from the buffer. csr_addr_o is the CSR address to commit stage.

The module has two internal signals: csr_reg_n and csr_reg_q. csr_reg_n is the next state of the buffer and csr_reg_q is the current state of the buffer.

The module has two processes: write and always_ff. The write process updates the next state of the buffer. The always_ff process updates the current state of the buffer.
