The `id_stage` module is the instruction decode stage. It receives a fetch entry from the IF stage, decodes it, and issues it to the ID stage. The module also checks if the instruction is a control flow instruction.

The module has two main parts: the compressed decoder and the decoder. The compressed decoder checks if the instruction is compressed and expands it if necessary. The decoder then decodes the instruction and emits it to the ID stage.

The module also has a pipeline register that stores the current instruction and its validity. This register is used to ensure that the ID stage does not issue an instruction that has already been issued.
