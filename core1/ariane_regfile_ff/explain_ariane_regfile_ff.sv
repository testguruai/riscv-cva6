# explain for: ariane_regfile_ff.sv
The ariane_regfile module implements a register file with 31 or 15x 32 bit wide registers. Register 0 is fixed to 0. This register file is based on flip flops.

The module has the following parameters:

- DATA_WIDTH: The width of the data bus.
- NR_READ_PORTS: The number of read ports.
- NR_WRITE_PORTS: The number of write ports.
- ZERO_REG_ZERO: A boolean value indicating whether register 0 should be fixed to 0.

The module has the following inputs:

- clk_i: The clock input.
- rst_ni: The reset input.
- test_en_i: A boolean value indicating whether clock gates should be disabled for testing.
- raddr_i: The read address inputs.
- waddr_i: The write address inputs.
- wdata_i: The write data inputs.
- we_i: The write enable inputs.

The module has the following outputs:

- rdata_o: The read data outputs.

The module uses a localparam to define the address width and the number of words in the register file.

The module uses a logic array to store the register file data.

The module uses a logic array to decode the write enable signals.

The module uses a always_ff block to write to the register file.

The module uses a for loop to assign the read data outputs.
