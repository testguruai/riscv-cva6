# Explanation for: csr_buffer.sv
This is a Verilog module for a buffer to hold CSR (Control and Status Register) addresses. The buffer acts as a functional unit to the scoreboard. The module has the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
- `clk_i`: Clock input
- `rst_ni`: Asynchronous reset input (active low)
- `flush_i`: Input to flush the buffer
- `fu_data_i`: Input data to the buffer
- `csr_valid_i`: Input signal indicating if a new CSR address is valid
- `csr_commit_i`: Input signal to commit the pending CSR operation

Outputs:
- `csr_ready_o`: Output signal indicating if the functional unit is ready (not busy)
- `csr_result_o`: Output signal with the result of a CSR operation
- `csr_addr_o`: Output signal with the address of the CSR to be committed in the next stage

The module contains a single-entry store buffer for the CSR address, consisting of a struct with two fields: `csr_address` and `valid`. The `csr_reg_n` and `csr_reg_q` variables are used to store the current and previous values of the register, respectively. 

The `write` always_comb block contains the control logic for the module. The `csr_ready_o` signal is set to 1 by default, and only set to 0 when there is a valid uncommitted CSR request or a new one is received without a commit, indicating that the module is not ready. If `csr_valid_i` is 1, the CSR address and the valid flag are stored in `csr_reg_n`. If `csr_commit_i` is 1 and there is no new valid instruction, the valid flag is cleared. If `flush_i` is 1, the valid flag is also cleared.

The `always_ff` block is the sequential process that synchronizes the `csr_reg_n` and `csr_reg_q` variables with the clock signal. When `rst_ni` is low, the `csr_reg_q` is set to 0. When `rst_ni` is high, `csr_reg_q` is updated with the new value of `csr_reg_n`. 

Overall, this module is used to store the address of the CSR request until it can be committed to the CSR file in the next stage. The module ensures that only one CSR request is held at a time and that the commit signal is respected.
