# Explanation for: store_buffer.sv
This is a Verilog module that implements a store buffer. The store buffer is a queue that holds pending store requests that have not yet been committed to memory. The module is used in conjunction with a load-store unit.

The module has inputs for the clock, reset, and flush signal. It also has inputs for the page offset, commit signal, and store data. There is an output for the state of the store buffer (empty or not), as well as outputs related to committing store requests.

The store buffer has two parts: a speculative queue and a commit queue. The speculative queue contains store requests that may or may not eventually be committed to memory (i.e. they are speculative). The commit queue contains store requests that will definitely be committed to memory.

The module contains logic for managing both queues. It reads and writes from the speculative queue when there is space available, and it evicts store requests from the speculative queue when they become non-speculative (i.e. they are ready to be committed to memory). When the flush signal is received, the speculative queue is cleared and all pending requests are invalidated.

The module is also responsible for interfacing with the load-store unit and the memory hierarchy. It accepts store requests from the load-store unit and sends them to the correct queue. When a store request is ready to be committed to memory, it sends the request to the memory hierarchy. Once the request has been committed, the module updates the status of the store buffer.The verilog code is implementing the memory interface for a commit queue. The commit queue is a buffer used to hold store requests that have been committed by the processor but have not yet been updated in memory. The code includes two sections: the Commit Queue Memory Interface and the Address Checker.

Commit Queue Memory Interface:
The section includes assign statements used to set the output signals of the port used to interface with the memory. These signals are:
- Kill_req: A signal that determines whether the memory needs to discard a previously issued request from the store buffer. The code sets this signal to 0, indicating that there is no need to discard any requests since all requests in the buffer are valid.
- Data_we: A signal that determines whether the memory needs to write data to the specified address. The code sets this signal to 1, indicating that data needs to be written to the specified address in memory.
- Tag_valid: A signal that determines whether the memory needs to use tag bits to check the validity of the address. The code sets this signal to 0 since tag bits are not needed.
- Address_index: A signal representing the index bits of the memory address where data will be written. The code sets this signal to the index bits of the address of the first request in the buffer.
- Address_tag: A signal representing the tag bits of the memory address where data will be written. The code sets this signal to the tag bits of the address of the first request in the buffer.
- Data_wdata: A signal representing the data that needs to be written in memory. The code sets this signal to the data of the first request in the buffer.
- Data_be: A signal representing the byte enable signals that determine which bytes of the data need to be written in memory. The code sets this signal to the byte enable signals of the first request in the buffer.
- Data_size: A signal representing the size of the data that needs to be written in memory. The code sets this signal to the size of the data of the first request in the buffer.

The section also includes an always_comb block (store_if) that updates the commit queue and generates signals used to interface with the memory. The block performs the following operations:
- It initializes a counter (commit_status_cnt) to the current value of a counter in the previous cycle (commit_status_cnt_q).
- It sets the commit_ready_o signal to 1 if the number of elements in the commit queue is less than the maximum depth of the queue. Otherwise, it sets the signal to 0 indicating that the commit queue is full.
- It sets the no_st_pending_o signal to 1 if there are no elements in the commit queue. Otherwise, it sets the signal to 0 indicating that there are still requests in the commit queue.
- It initializes the commit read pointer and write pointer to their previous values (commit_read_pointer_q and commit_write_pointer_q).
- It sets the commit queue to the previous value of the commit queue (commit_queue_q).
- It sets the data_req signal to 0 indicating that there is no data request to send to the memory.
- It checks if the first element in the commit queue is valid. If it is, it sets the data_req signal to 1 indicating that there is a data request to send to the memory. If the data_gnt signal from the memory is received, it removes the first element from the commit queue, advances the read pointer, and decrements the commit_status_cnt counter.
- It shifts a store request from the speculative buffer to the non-speculative buffer if there is a commit signal (commit_i) and the speculative buffer is not empty.
- It sets the commit_status_cnt_n signal to the updated value of the commit_status_cnt counter.

Address Checker:
The section includes an always_comb block (address_checker) that checks if the memory address of a load request matches any address in the commit queue or the speculative queue. The block performs the following operations:
- It initializes a page_offset_matches_o signal to 0.
- It checks each element in the commit queue and the speculative queue to see if the page offset of the memory address of the load request (page_offset_i) matches the page offset of the memory address of each request in the commit queue and the speculative queue. If a match is found and the corresponding request is valid, the block sets the page_offset_matches_o signal to 1.
- It checks if the load request's memory address matches the memory address of a request that is currently being added to the queue (i.e., valid_without_flush_i signal is true). If there is a match, it also sets the page_offset_matches_o signal to 1.This Verilog code defines two sets of registers, "speculative" and "commit", which are used for speculative execution within a CPU. Each set of registers has four registers: a queue, a read pointer, a write pointer, and a status count.

The code also includes several assertions to ensure that the registers are being used correctly. These assertions check for conditions such as trying to commit and flush in the same cycle, trying to push new data into a buffer that is not ready, and trying to commit a store when the buffer is full.
