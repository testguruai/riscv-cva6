This is the verilog code for a flush controller module used in a RISC-V based processor. A flush controller is used to flush out the contents of the pipeline in case of certain events such as a mispredicted branch, a memory fence, an exception, etc. The module takes multiple inputs, including clock and reset signals, and provides multiple outputs, including signals to flush different stages of the pipeline, flush the branch predictor, flush the instruction and data caches, flush the TLBs and a halt signal.

The module consists of two logic blocks - 'flush_ctrl' and 'halt logic', and a set of registers to store the signals.

The 'flush_ctrl' logic block is an always_comb block. It follows the principle of Combinational Logic in digital electronics, where outputs are purely based on logic, without the use of any memory elements. It uses a set of if-else statements to set the various output signals based on the input signals received. Some of the input signals received are resolved_branch_i, fence_i, fence_i_i, sfence_vma_i, flush_csr_i, flush_commit_i, ex_valid_i, eret_i, and set_debug_pc_i. These inputs are used to set appropriate output signals such as flush_if_o, flush_unissued_instr_o, flush_id_o, flush_ex_o, flush_icache_o, flush_dcache_o, flush_tlb_o, flush_bp_o, set_pc_commit_o, etc. The logic in this block handles all the scenarios of pipeline flushing, based on the input signals received.

The 'halt logic' block is also an always_comb block. It is used to set the halt signal to the commit stage based on the values of the input signals received such as halt_csr_i and fence_active_q. The output signal is used to stall the fetch stage so that no instructions are fetched during the flush period.

Finally, the registers in the module store the output signals of the combinatorial logic block and the signals are updated on the rising edge of the clock signal.

Overall, this flush controller module is an important module essential for the smooth functioning of the processor. It ensures that the pipeline is appropriately flushed in case of various pipeline events, resulting in efficient and accurate execution of instructions.
