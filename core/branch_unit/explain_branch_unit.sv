# VerifAI TestGuru
# Explanation for: branch_unit.sv
This is a Verilog module that implements a branch unit, used in the control path of a RISC-V processor. The module generates the target address for control flow instructions (branches and jumps) and compares this address against the one predicted by the branch predictor unit of the processor. 

The module takes the following inputs:
- `clk_i`: clock signal
- `rst_ni`: active low reset signal
- `debug_mode_i`: a signal indicating whether the processor is in debug mode
- `fu_data_i`: input data for the functional unit (which depends on the specific control flow instruction being executed)
- `pc_i`: the program counter of the current instruction
- `is_compressed_instr_i`: a flag indicating whether the instruction is compressed (16-bit) or not (32-bit)
- `fu_valid_i`: a flag indicating whether the functional unit is valid (i.e. whether the control flow instruction is currently executing)
- `branch_valid_i`: a flag indicating whether the instruction is a branch (i.e. whether the module should calculate and compare target addresses)
- `branch_comp_res_i`: the result of the comparison between the calculated target address and the one predicted by the branch predictor
- `branch_predict_i`: the predicted target address from the branch predictor

The module produces the following outputs:
- `branch_result_o`: the calculated target address for the control flow instruction
- `resolved_branch_o`: the resolved control flow instruction with updated target address, taken flag, and type (branch, jump, or return)
- `resolve_branch_o`: a signal indicating that the branch has been resolved and the scoreboard can accept new entries
- `branch_exception_o`: an exception signal indicating whether there was an instruction fetch exception due to an unaligned target address for a jump or branch instruction

The module contains two `always_comb` blocks. The first block (`mispredict_handler`) calculates the target address and generates the resolved branch output, based on the current PC and the functional unit data. It also handles mispredicts by checking the outcome of the branch speculation and updating the resolved branch output accordingly. The second block (`exception_handling`) generates the branch exception output if the target address is not aligned to a 2 byte boundary.
