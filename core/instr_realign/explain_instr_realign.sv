# Explanation for: instr_realign.sv
This is a Verilog module for instruction re-alignment in a RISC-V processor. It is responsible for extracting aligned and unaligned instructions from 32-bit aligned cache blocks. The module takes inputs from the clock, reset, flush, and data bus of the processor and gives output signals indicating whether an instruction is unaligned, the instruction validity, instruction address, and instruction data.

The `instr_is_compressed` signal keeps track of whether an instruction within a fetch block is compressed or not. It is a 4-bit signal, and a value of 1 indicates that the corresponding instruction within the fetch block is compressed.

The `unaligned_instr_d` signal is a 16-bit signal that stores the unaligned part of the instruction received in the previous cycle. The `unaligned_q` signal indicates whether the last instruction was unaligned or not. The `unaligned_address_d` signal saves the unaligned address of the instruction in the previous cycle.

The `serving_unaligned_o` signal is a single-bit output signal indicating whether the module is currently serving an unaligned instruction located at the beginning of the instruction fetch block.

The `valid_o` signal is a 2-bit output that indicates the validity of the instructions in the fetch block. The `instr_o` signal is a 64-bit output that contains the instruction data for all instructions in the fetch block. The `addr_o` signal is a 128-bit output that contains the address of all four instructions in the fetch block.

The `realign_bp_32` block implements the instruction re-alignment logic. It begins with an `always_comb` block that assigns signals related to the unaligned instruction to their respective registers. It then sets the `valid_o`, `instr_o`, and `addr_o` signals for the aligned instructions in the fetch block.

The logic for handling unaligned instructions and compressed instructions is implemented in this block. If an instruction is unaligned or compressed, the `unaligned_d`, `valid_o`, `instr_o`, and `addr_o` signals are updated to reflect this. Additionally, if an instruction is unaligned, its address and data are saved in separate registers.

Finally, there is logic to handle the case when the instruction fetch begins on an unaligned boundary. In this case, the module waits for the next instruction to arrive before processing the instructions. If the next instruction is not compressed, the instruction is saved as unaligned in the `unaligned_d` signal, and the `valid_o`, `unaligned_address_d`, and `unaligned_instr_d` signals are updated accordingly. If the next instruction is compressed, it is processed normally in the next cycle.This Verilog code is used for instruction realignment and boundary crossing in a RISC-V processor. It is specifically designed for a fetch width of 64 bits.

The code has several blocks that handle different scenarios depending on the alignment and size of fetched instructions. At a high level, the code takes in a 64-bit instruction fetch and outputs four 32-bit instructions after performing any necessary realignment and addressing modifications. 

The code block labeled "realign_bp_64" contains the main logic for realignment. It first checks if the fetch width is 64 bits, and if so, enters an initial block and outputs an error message since this code is not properly implemented for this case. 

Next, the "re_align" block is defined using an "always_comb" construct. This block sets the output values for each of the four instruction slots based on the input values and the current alignment and instruction compression.

The "valid_o" output signals are set by copying the value of the single "valid_i" input signal into the least significant bit of the "valid_o" output signal.

The "addr_o" outputs are set based on the input "address_i" signal. Slot 0 is set to the input address, slot 1 is set to the input address shifted by three bits and with the three least significant bits set to 010 (hexadecimal 2), slot 2 is set to the input address similarly shifted and set to 100 (hexadecimal 4), and slot 3 is set to the input address similarly shifted and set to 110 (hexadecimal 6).

The "instr_o" outputs are set based on the input "data_i" signal and the instruction compression status of each slot. 

If the previous instruction was unaligned, then slot 0 is set to the concatenated value of the least significant 16 bits of the input signal and the upper half of the previous unaligned instruction. The value of "unaligned_instr_q" is also set to the upper half of the previous unaligned instruction and stored in "unaligned_instr_d". The address of the previous unaligned instruction is stored in "unaligned_address_d".

If the first instruction is compressed, then the second instruction is placed in slot 1. If the second instruction is also compressed, then it is placed in slot 2. If the third instruction is compressed, then it is placed in slot 3. If the third instruction is not compressed, then it is unaligned (because the fetch starts on an odd byte boundary), and the value of "unaligned_d" is set to 1. The address and upper half of the unaligned instruction are stored in "unaligned_address_d" and "unaligned_instr_d", respectively.

If the first instruction is not compressed, then the second instruction is placed in slot 1, and if it is compressed, the third instruction is placed in slot 2. If the third instruction is also compressed, then it is placed in slot 3. If the third instruction is not compressed, then it is unaligned and handled as before.

If all instructions are aligned (i.e., no unaligned instructions), then the output values are simply copied from the input values, with the exception of slot 1, which is set to the value of "data_i" shifted by 32 bits and with 16 leading zeroes.

Finally, the code also responds to unaligned fetches when the input address is not aligned to a 64-bit boundary. There are three cases: when the input address is offset by 2 bytes, 4 bytes, or 6 bytes. In each case, the code appropriately sets the output values of the three instruction slots to be either compressed or unaligned as dictated by the input data.This is a Verilog module that represents a flip-flop with some conditional operations applied to the input signals. The module has three input signals: clk_i (clock), rst_ni (reset), valid_i, and flush_i, and three output signals: unaligned_q, unaligned_address_q, and unaligned_instr_q.

The always_ff block is triggered by both the positive edge of the clock and negative edge of the reset signal. The if-else statement within the always_ff block first checks if the reset signal is low. If it is low, all three output signals are set to 0. If the reset signal is not low, the block continues to check if the input signal valid_i is high. If it is high, the unaligned_address_q and unaligned_instr_q output signals are updated with the corresponding values from the previous clock cycle.

The block then checks if the flush_i input signal is high. If it is high, the unaligned_q output signal is set to 0. Otherwise, if the valid_i signal is high, the unaligned_q output signal is updated with the corresponding value from the previous clock cycle.

Overall, this module acts like a flip-flop with some logic to handle special cases like reset and flushing.
