# VerifAI TestGuru Explanation for: ariane.sv
This is a Verilog code for the top-level module of the Ariane RISC-V processor. 
It defines a module named "ariane" and imports various packages, 
including the Ariane package and the CVXIF package. 
The module has a number of input and output ports, including clock and 
reset signals, interrupt inputs, and memory request and response signals. 
  
The module instantiates a CVA6 module (a specific implementation of the Ariane processor), 
and a CVXIF example coprocessor module (if CVXIF is present). 
The module also defines a parameter ArianeCfg, 
which is set to the default configuration of the Ariane processor.
