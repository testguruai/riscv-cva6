## UVM Test Bench and Test for LSU Bypass

To write a UVM test bench and UVM test for the provided Verilog code for LSU Bypass module, first we need to understand the functionality of the LSU module. 

The LSU module consist of two independent blocks, Load Unit and Store Unit, which share a common address translation block. The LSU Control module handles address calculation and memory interface signals for both the blocks. It consists of two element FIFO for each block which stores the request in case we need to apply it later. LSU Control module signals the readiness of the blocks by separate signals. If they are not ready, it keeps the last applied signals stable. It also samples any incoming request for the blocks and stores it in the respective FIFO. It is necessary to store the requests in FIFO as we only know very late in the cycle whether the load/store will succeed. LSU Control handles flush_i, pop_ld_i, and pop_st_i signals to empty the respective FIFO.

Based on the above explanation, we can write the UVM test bench and UVM test for the LSU Bypass module.

### Test Bench

The UVM test bench for the LSU Bypass module needs to perform the following tasks:
1. Generate random LSU requests for the Load Unit and Store Unit blocks
2. Drive the lsu_req_i and lsu_req_valid_i signals with the respective random requests
3. Drive the pop_ld_i and pop_st_i signals randomly to empty the Load Unit and Store Unit FIFO respectively
4. Drive the flush_i signal randomly to empty both the FIFOs
5. Monitor the read_pointer_q and write_pointer_q signals to verify the proper storage of requests in the FIFOs
6. Monitor the lsu_ctrl_o and ready_o signals to verify the proper handling of incoming requests, stability of last applied signals, and FIFO empty status
7. Randomize the seed for each simulation

```systemverilog
`include "uvm_macros.svh"
`include "uvm_test_top.svh"

module lsu_bypass_tb;
    // Inputs and outputs
    logic clk_i, rst_ni, flush_i, lsu_req_valid_i, pop_ld_i, pop_st_i;
    lsu_ctrl_t lsu_req_i, lsu_ctrl_o;
    logic ready_o;

    // UVM components
    `UVM_COMPONENT_UTILS(lsu_bypass_tb)

    // Create an agent
    lsu_bypass_agent lsu_bypass_agnt;

    // Create a virtual interface
    virtual lsu_if lsu_vif;

    // Constructor
    function new(string name="", uvm_component parent=null);
        super.new(name, parent);

        // Create virtual interface instance
        lsu_vif = new("lsu_vif");

        // Create an agent instance and set the virtual interface
        lsu_bypass_agnt = lsu_bypass_agent::type_id::create("lsu_bypass_agnt", this);
        lsu_bypass_agnt.if_vif = lsu_vif;
    endfunction

    // Test case - Random test for LSU Bypass
    task run_phase(uvm_phase phase);
        // Create and start the UVM sequence
        lsu_bypass_seq lsu_byp_seq = lsu_bypass_seq::type_id::create("lsu_byp_seq");
        assert(lsu_byp_seq.start(lsu_bypass_agnt));

        // Wait for the UVM sequence to complete
        assert(lsu_byp_seq.wait_for_sequence_end());

        // Finish the test
        phase.raise_objection(this);
        `uvm_info(get_type_name(), "Test Passed", UVM_LOW)
        phase.drop_objection(this);
    endtask

    // UVM connect phase callback
    function void connect_phase(uvm_phase phase);
        super.connect_phase(phase);

        // Connect the interface of the DUT with the agent virtual interface
        `uvm_info(get_type_name(), "Connecting DUT and Agent interfaces", UVM_MEDIUM)
        lsu_vif.connect(lsu_bypass_agnt.vif);

        // Connect the UVM port and interface with the DUT
        `uvm_info(get_type_name(), "Connecting DUT and UVM hierarchical connections", UVM_MEDIUM)
        lsu_bypass lsu_0(.clk_i(clk_i), .rst_ni(rst_ni), .flush_i(flush_i), .lsu_req_i(lsu_req_i), .lsu_req_valid_i(lsu_req_valid_i),
                        .pop_ld_i(pop_ld_i), .pop_st_i(pop_st_i), .lsu_ctrl_o(lsu_ctrl_o), .ready_o(ready_o));
        lsu_vif.driver.connect(lsu_bypass_agnt.agent_driver.ap, "*");
        lsu_vif.driver.master.connect(lsu_0);
        lsu_vif.monitor.connect(lsu_bypass_agnt.agent_monitor.ap, "*");
        lsu_vif.monitor.slave.connect(lsu_0);
    endfunction

    // UVM end_of_elaboration phase callback
    function void end_of_elaboration_phase(uvm_phase phase);
        super.end_of_elaboration_phase(phase);

        // Create a configuration object and set default/random values
        lsu_bypass_config lsu_byp_cfg = lsu_bypass_agnt.get_config_object();

        // Set random seed and apply any command line configuration overrides
        `uvm_info(get_type_name(), {"Applied configuration: ", lsu_byp_cfg.set_config_string("*", ""), ""}, UVM_MEDIUM)
        `uvm_info(get_type_name(), {"Random Seed: ", lsu_byp_cfg.random_seed}, UVM_MEDIUM)
        `uvm_set_randstate(lsu_byp_cfg.random_seed)
    endfunction
endmodule : lsu_bypass_tb
```

In the UVM test bench, we have instantiated the LSU Bypass module with the name lsu_0 and created an agent instance lsu_bypass_agnt. We have created a virtual interface instance named lsu_vif and connected the agent's interface with the DUT's interface through it. We have also connected the UVM ports and interfaces with the DUT through the virtual interface.

We have defined a test case for the random test of the LSU Bypass module. In this test case, we are creating an instance of the lsu_bypass_seq sequence and starting it with the agent instance. We are waiting for the lsu_bypass_seq sequence to complete and finishing the test with a UVM info message.

We have implemented the connect_phase callback to connect the interfaces of the agent and the DUT with the virtual interface. We have also connected the UVM ports and interfaces with the DUT through the virtual interface.

We have implemented the end_of_elaboration_phase callback to set the random seed and apply any command line configuration overrides.

### UVM Test

The UVM test for the LSU Bypass module needs to extend the uvm_test class and perform the following tasks:
1. Randomly generate LSU requests for the Load Unit and Store Unit blocks
2. Drive the lsu_req_i and lsu_req_valid_i signals with the respective random requests
3. Drive the pop_ld_i and pop_st_i signals randomly to empty the Load Unit and Store Unit FIFO respectively
4. Drive the flush_i signal randomly to empty both the FIFOs
5. Monitor the read_pointer_q and write_pointer_q signals to verify the proper storage of requests in the FIFOs
6. Monitor the lsu_ctrl_o and ready_o signals to verify the proper handling of incoming requests, stability of last applied signals, and FIFO empty status
7. Randomize the seed for each simulation

```systemverilog
`include "uvm_macros.svh"
`include "uvm_test_top.svh"

class lsu_bypass_test extends uvm_test;

    // UVM components
    lsu_bypass_tb lsu_byp_tb;
    uvm_config_db#(virtual lsu_if)::set(cmp_ptr, "*", "vif", lsu_byp_tb.lsu_vif);

    // Constructor
    function new(string name="lsu_bypass_test", uvm_component parent=null);
        super.new(name, parent);
    endfunction

    // UVM run phase callback
    virtual task run_phase(uvm_phase phase);
        super.run_phase(phase);
        lsu_byp_tb = lsu_bypass_tb::type_id::create("lsu_byp_tb", this);
        phase.raise_objection(lsu_byp_tb);
        phase.drop_objection(lsu_byp_tb);
    endtask
endclass : lsu_bypass_test
```

In the UVM test, we have created a uvm_test class named lsu_bypass_test that extends the uvm_test class. We have created an instance of the LSU Bypass test bench and set its virtual interface in the configuration database for the UVM test.

We have implemented the run_phase callback to create an instance of the LSU Bypass test bench and raise and drop objections for it.

### Conclusion

In this example, we have written the UVM test bench and UVM test for the provided Verilog code for the LSU Bypass module. The UVM test bench generates random requests for the Load Unit and Store Unit blocks, drives the signals for LSU Control module and FIFOs, and monitors the signals for LSU Control module and FIFOs. The UVM test randomly tests the LSU Bypass module with different test scenarios.
