# VerifAI TestGuru
# Explanation for: cvxif_fu.sv
This is a Verilog module for the logic of the CoreV-X-Interface. The module receives inputs including clock, reset, functional unit data, x_valid_i (valid flag for instructions), x_off_instr_i (offset instruction), and cvxif_resp_i (response from the CoreV-X-Interface). The module outputs x_ready_o (ready flag for instructions), x_trans_id_o (transaction ID), x_exception_o (exception information), x_result_o (result of instructions), x_valid_o (valid flag for results), x_we_o (write enable flag for results), and cvxif_req_o (request to the CoreV-X-Interface). 

The module contains two always_comb blocks that are triggered by changes in input values. One block takes input and constructs a request message to the CoreV-X-Interface. The other block reads the response message from the CoreV-X-Interface and outputs the result to the pipeline. In the second block, an illegal instruction flag is also checked and if set, an exception is thrown.

The always_ff block is triggered by the positive edge of the clock and the negative edge of the reset. It is used to store the state of the illegal instruction flag for the next clock cycle.
